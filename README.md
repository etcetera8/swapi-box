## SWAPI-BOX

[live page](http://swapi-box.surge.sh/)

I created this project using the Star Wars API, React, asynchronus JS, and a full testing suite with Jest and Enzyme. 

When the user first visits the site they are immediately greeted with scrolling text from one of the Star Wars movies. As the user clicks on one of the three categories, people, planets, or vehicles, another fetch call is made and they are shown 10 of that category. Users have the ability to favorite cards. When they visits the favorites tab they are able to see all of their favorited cards where they can defavorite them if wanted. I also used local storage to store the initial fetch calls so on returning fetch calls would not need to be used again.
